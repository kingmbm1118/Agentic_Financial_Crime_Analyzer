### Complete Flow Explanation

#### **Step 1: Transaction Monitoring**
- Bank's SAS system detects transaction
- Calculates ML fraud score (0-1)
- Flags anomalies (amount, location, time)
- **Example**: Mohammed Ahmed transfers 25,000 SAR to UAE at 2:30 AM

#### **Step 2: AI Alerting Agent** (LLaMA)
- Analyzes transaction with AI
- Checks: amount, time, country, customer history
- **Classifies as**: FLAGGED / INVESTIGATE / NON_FRAUD
- Provides explainable reasoning
- **Example**: "FLAGGED - Amount 12.5x above average, unusual time"

#### **Step 3: Monitoring Agent**
- Reviews AI classification
- **Decides**: CREATE_CASE / CLOSE / REQUEST_MORE_INFO
- Assigns priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **Example**: "Create case CASE_00000001 - HIGH priority"

#### **Step 4: Investigator Agent**
- Deep analysis using multiple sources:
  - Customer profile (KYC, PEP, nationality)
  - Login history (countries, devices, 2FA)
  - Device fingerprints (trusted/suspicious)
  - Transaction patterns
- **Final decision**: CONFIRMED_FRAUD / SUSPECTED_FRAUD / LEGITIMATE
- **Example**: "SUSPECTED_FRAUD - Contact customer for verification"

#### **Step 5: Report Generation**
Two types created automatically:
- **Word Document** (.docx): Professional case report with SAMA compliance
- **Text File** (.txt): Quick reference report

## üéØ Key Features

‚óè Saudi Bank Fraud Detection System - Simple Explanation

  What is this system?

  This is an AI-powered system that helps Saudi banks detect fraudulent money transfers automatically. Think of it
  as a smart assistant that reviews every transfer and flags suspicious ones for investigation.

  ---
  How does it work? (Step by step)

  1. Transfer Happens

  - Customer initiates a money transfer (e.g., 50,000 SAR to UAE)
  - System receives the transfer details: amount, beneficiary, country, etc.

  2. AI Analysis (Happens in seconds)

  The system uses 3 AI agents working together:

  Agent 1: Alert Agent

  - Reviews the transfer
  - Checks: Is the amount unusual? Is the country risky? Is the beneficiary new?
  - Decision: FLAGGED (high risk) / INVESTIGATE (medium risk) / NON_FRAUD (safe)

  Agent 2: Monitoring Agent

  - Reviews Agent 1's decision
  - Decision:
    - If suspicious ‚Üí Creates a case for investigation
    - If safe ‚Üí Closes automatically

  Agent 3: Investigator Agent

  - Deep analysis if case is created
  - Checks multiple sources:
    - Customer profile (KYC, previous fraud history)
    - Login history (which countries, devices used)
    - Device fingerprints (trusted/suspicious devices)
    - Transfer patterns
  - Final Decision: CONFIRMED_FRAUD / SUSPECTED_FRAUD / LEGITIMATE

  3. Reports Generated

  - Word Document (.docx) - Professional case report for managers
  - Text Report (.txt) - Quick reference
  - Both include:
    - Why it was flagged
    - What was checked
    - Recommended actions

  Real Example

  Transfer: Ahmed transfers 45,000 SAR to Syria at 2 AM

  AI Analysis:
  1. ‚úÖ Amount is 10x his average (red flag)
  2. ‚úÖ Syria is high-risk country (red flag)
  3. ‚úÖ Transfer at 2 AM unusual time (red flag)
  4. ‚úÖ Customer's KYC not verified (red flag)

  Result: FLAGGED ‚Üí Case created ‚Üí Investigation ‚Üí SUSPECTED_FRAUD

  Action: Block transfer, contact customer, verify identity
